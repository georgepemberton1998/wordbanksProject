<h3>Do you ever feel like just reading a definition isn't enough for it to stick?</h3>
Well, that's because of <em>'simple'</em> neuropsychology. When we just read  or hear information,
our brain struggles<br> to differentiate between things that matter, and things that dont.
However, when we write (and or type)<br> special parts of our brains are 'activated', making
it easy to store the important information for the long term.

and what goes.<br> <Strong>You</Strong> can be the one to say "No, I dont <em>only</em> need to remember how to brew a
splash potion of weakness in Minecraft".
